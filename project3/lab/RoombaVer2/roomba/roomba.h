 * \param radius The radius of the Roomba's turn, in mm.  A negative radius is a left turn and a positive radius is
 * 		a right turn.  A radius value of 0x8000 means go as straight as possible (the Roomba is not capable of going
 * 		truly straight).  A radius value of -1 means turn in place clockwise, and 1 means turn in place counter-
 * 		clockwise.  The range of valid values is -2000 to 2000.
